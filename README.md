## üëã Welcome!
**I am Isabel Ruiz.**
**Bioinformatician and Evolutionary Biologist.**

## About Me
I am a researcher with a strong passion to explore the world of non-model organism and the evolutionary history behind them. Eukarya enthusiastic! I hold a MSc. Bioinformatics form the University of Bristol (2023/24), graduated with distinction, and a BSc. Biology from the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about contributing to the improvement of pipelines for NGS analysis and their downstream application.

Relevant position:
* Collaborate the practical sessions for the undergraduate Evolution course at Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University (Tree-Thinking, Phylogenetic Reconstruction, Data Mining and Topics in R).
* Freelancer, specializing in NGS data analysis and applications of AI  (Machine Learning and Image processing).
