## üëã Welcome!
**I am Isabel Ruiz.**
**Bioinformatician and Evolutionary Biologist.**

## About Me
I am a researcher with a strong passion for exploring the evolutionary history of sensing and perception in the context of multicellularity, with a particular interest in non-model organisms. Eukarya enthusiastic! I hold a MSc. Bioinformatics form the University of Bristol (2023/24), graduated with distinction, and a BSc. Biology from the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University. I am eager to help advance and refine workflows for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and their applications in genomics and evolutionary biology.

Relevant position:
* Research Assistant in the Andean Bear Project at the [Research Institute for Ecology and Coservation](https://www.iiecco.org) (Trujillo, Peru).
* Collaborated in the design and leading of practical sessions for the Evolution undergrad course at Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University (Tree-Thinking, Phylogenetic Reconstruction, Data Mining and Topics in R).
* Freelancer, specializing in NGS data analysis and applications of AI  (Machine Learning and Image processing).

## Research interests
* Evolution of sensing and perception, particularly the role of gene duplications in the emergence of novel traits.
* Integration of multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell sequencing) to reconstruct evolutionary changes in a stepwise.
* Large-scale phylogenetic analyses to uncover the natural history of life, combining with artificial intelligence to refine analytical methodologies.
