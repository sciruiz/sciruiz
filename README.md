## üëã Welcome!
**I am Isabel Ruiz.**
**Bioinformatician and Evolutionary Biologist.**

## About Me
I am a researcher with a strong passion for exploring the evolutionary history of sensing and perception in the context of multicellularity, with a particular interest in non-model organisms. Eukarya enthusiastic! I hold a MSc. Bioinformatics form the University of Bristol (2023/24), graduated with distinction, and a BSc. Biology from the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University. I am eager to help advance and refine workflows for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and their applications in genomics and evolutionary biology.

Relevant experience:
* Designed and implemented a bioinformatics workflow to extract genes of interest from Illumina sequencing data‚Äîintegrating FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, and Samtools/BCFtools in a Unix environment, to  streamline gene extraction and enhanced future genomic (see more in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sciruiz/euk-illumina-gene-extraction-pipeline)) and automatization of phylogenetic analyses (see more in [Kawsay Tree](https://github.com/sciruiz/KawsayTree)). 
* Supported ecological research on the Andean bear by contributing to organising and pre-processing of the data that informed habitat modeling and conservation strategies in northern Peru.
* Co-designed and led practical sessions on phylogenetic reconstruction, data mining, and R-based analysis, improving students‚Äô practical understanding of evolutionary methods and computational tools (see more in [EvoTutorials](https://sciruiz.github.io/evotutorials)).

## Research interests
* Evolution of sensing and perception, particularly the role of gene duplications in the emergence of novel traits.
* Integration of multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell sequencing) to reconstruct evolutionary changes in a stepwise.
* Large-scale phylogenetic analyses to uncover the natural history of life, combining with artificial intelligence to refine analytical methodologies.
