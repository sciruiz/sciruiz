## 👋 Welcome!
**I am Isabel Ruiz.**
**Bioinformatician and Biologist.**

## About Me
I am a biologist and researcher with a strong passion for evolution and biodiversity. I hold a MSc. Bioinformatics form the University of Bristol (2023/24), graduated with distinction, and a BSc. Biology from the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University. I’m enthusiastic about contributing to the improvement of pipelines for NGS analysis and their downstream application.

Current position:
* Coordinator for the practical session the at Evolution undergrad course at Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University.
* Bioinformatics consultant at the [Protozoan and Endosymbiont Pathogens](https://investigacion.cayetano.edu.pe/catalogo/biotecnologia-lpep/).
* Freelancer, specializing in NGS data analysis and applications of AI  (Machine Learning and Image processing).
  
Previous positions:
* I collaborated as research assistant at the [Marine Biology Lab](https://investigacion.cayetano.edu.pe/catalogo/ecologia-biomarina/) after completing my undergrad thesis.
