## üëã Welcome!
**I am Isabel Ruiz.**
**Bioinformatician and Evolutionary Biologist.**

## About Me
I am a researcher fascinated by how organisms sense and perceive their environment. Eukarya enthusiast! I hold a MSc. Bioinformatics from the University of Bristol (2023/24), graduated with distinction, and a BSc. Biology from the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University. I am eager to contribute in workflows development for next-generation sequencing and large-scale sequences analyses, with a focus on their downstream applications in evolutionary biology.

## Relevant experience:
* Designed and implemented a bioinformatics workflow to extract genes of interest from Illumina sequencing data in a Unix environment, to  facilitate gene extraction from molluscs genomes (see more in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sciruiz/euk-illumina-gene-extraction-pipeline)).
* Assisted in an academic session for Pipeline Development using as example the automatization of mitochondrial coding-sequences to build a phylogenetic analysis (see more in [Kawsay Tree](https://github.com/sciruiz/KawsayTree)) at the National University of San Marcos with *Dr. Rer. Nat.* Pedro E. Romero. 
* Co-designed and led practical sessions on phylogenetic reconstruction, data mining, and R-based analysis, improving the students‚Äô practical understanding of evolutionary methods and computational tools (see more in [EvoTutorials](https://sciruiz.github.io/evotutorials)), at the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University with *Dr. Rer. Nat.* Armando Valdes.
